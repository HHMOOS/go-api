PowerOffice Go SDK NuGet Package
================================

To allow for easy installation and upgrades of the PowerOffice Go SDK we have chosen to distribute it through the [NuGet Package Manager](https://www.nuget.org/). NuGet is supported by Microsoft Visual Studio.

## Install NuGet Package Manager
If you don't have NuGet already you will have to [install it first.](http://docs.nuget.org/consume/installing-nuget)

## Install PowerOffice Go SDK
After installing NuGet you can easily install PowerOffice Go SDK in a .NET Project or Solution using the NuGet Package Manager Console:

1. Click *Tools->NuGet Package Manager->Package Manager Console
2. Run the following command in the Package Manager Console: 
	>PM> **Install-Package PowerOfficeGoSdk**

The PowerOfficeGoSdk NuGet package (and dependencies) will be downloaded and installed in the project.
