Registration and Client activation
==================================

## Register as a PowerOffice Go user

You must have a PowerOffice Go user before you can register your application.

Currently you must request access to PowerOffice Go [here](http://www.poweroffice.no/go/jeg-onsker-a-vite-mer-om-go/) or an existing user must invite you.


## Registering your application

Each application that will connect to PowerOffice Go using the Go-Api must be registered before it can access the api functions.

Once your PowerOffice Go user has been activated, you can register an application and receive an *application key*.

[Register your application here.](http://api.poweroffice.net/register)

### Application Key

When you register your application you will receive an *application key*. This key is used to request authorization when performing API calls.

## Client activation

To allow your application to access a PowerOffice Go client the administrator of the client must grant your application access rights by activating it in the PowerOffice Go *extensions settings*.


See [here](http://) for instructions on how a user can activate an application for a PowerOffice Go client. 

### Client Key
When the user has activated your application, the user will see a *client key* in PowerOffice Go. This key identifies the PowerOffice Go client for your application.

The user must provide you with this key.
