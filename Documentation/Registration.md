Registration and Client activation
==================================

## Register as a PowerOffice Go user

You must have a PowerOffice Go user before you can register your application.

Currently you must request access to PowerOffice Go [here](http://www.poweroffice.no/go/) or an existing user must invite you.


## Registering your application

Each application that will connect to PowerOffice Go using the Go-Api must be registered before it can access the api functions.

Once your PowerOffice Go user has been activated, you can register an application and receive an *application key*.

Currenly we only support applications through e-mail. To apply for an application to use PowerOffice Go API, send an e-mail to go-api@poweroffice.no stating your company name, system name, who you're representing, contact e-mail address and the purpose of the integration.

### Application Key

When you register your application you will receive an *application key*. This key is used to request authorization when performing API calls.

## Client activation

To allow your application to access a PowerOffice Go client the administrator of the client must grant your application access rights by activating it in the PowerOffice Go *extensions settings*.

### Client Key
When the user has activated your application, the user will see a *client key* in PowerOffice Go. This key identifies the PowerOffice Go client for your application.

The user must provide you with this key.
