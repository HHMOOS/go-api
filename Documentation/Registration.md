Registration and Client activation
==================================

Before the GO-API can be used, you must register as an integration partner, and the end user must grant your integration access to it's PowerOffice GO client. 

## Registering as an integration partner

Before an integration component can request access to the API the developer must [register as an integration partner.](http://api.go.poweroffice.net/register)

When you register you will receive a *developer key*. This key is used to request authorization.

## Client activation

The user must activate your integration in the PowerOffice GO user interface.

See [here](todo:) for user instructions on how to activat an integration for a PowerOffice GO client. 

When the user has activated your integration, the user will see a *client key* in PowerOffice GO. This key identifies the PowerOffice GO client for your integarion component. The user must provide you with this key.
